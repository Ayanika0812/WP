create webapp/templates/webapp/index.html
   -> Check the View Configuration
    In your webapp/views.py, ensure the home view is rendering the correct template:

    # webapp/views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def home(request):
        return render(request, 'webapp/index.html')  # Correct path to the template

    ->Update the URL Configuration for the App
    Make sure the webapp/urls.py is set up correctly to map the root URL (/) to the home view. If you havenâ€™t created this file yet, create it as follows:

    # webapp/urls.py
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.home, name='home'),  # This should route to the home view
    ]
    ->Include App URLs in the Project's urls.py
    In your myproject/urls.py, ensure that the URLs for webapp are included:

    # myproject/urls.py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', include('webapp.urls')),  # Include the webapp URLs here
    ]
    ->Ensure Template Directory is Set Correctly
    In your myproject/settings.py, make sure the TEMPLATES setting is configured to look for templates in the webapp/templates/ directory:

    TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [
            BASE_DIR / "templates",  # If you're using a global templates folder
        ],
